# Project Rules

## General Guidelines

- All code, comments, documentation, and commit messages must be written in English.
- Maintain consistency across the entire codebase.
- Prioritize readability and maintainability over clever solutions.
- Follow the principle of least surprise - code should behave as other developers would expect.
- Document architectural decisions and the reasoning behind them.

## Communication

- Use clear and concise English in all project-related communications.
- Document decisions made during meetings or discussions in a shared location.
- When asking questions, provide context and what you've already tried.
- Be respectful and constructive when providing feedback.

## Documentation

- Keep documentation up-to-date with the current state of the project.
- Document the "why" behind decisions, not just the "what" and "how".
- Include setup instructions for new developers in the README.
- Document known limitations and edge cases.
- Use diagrams where appropriate to explain complex systems or workflows.
